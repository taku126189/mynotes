  // the main function is not recompiled even if you did a hot reload. "recompile" refers to the process of rebuilding the application's source code into machine-readable code (such as native machine code or intermediate code) that can be executed on the target platform. This compilation process is necessary whenever changes are made to the source code of a Flutter app. When you make changes to your Flutter project, such as modifying Dart code, adding dependencies, or adjusting configuration files, you need to recompile the application to see the effects of those changes. The Flutter framework provides a hot reload feature, which allows you to see the results of your code changes quickly without restarting the entire application.

// named routes vs anonymous routes
// routes are a journey. it has a start view and end view.
// named routes tell Flutter where to go beforehand.
// anonymous routes does not tell Flutter the final destination.

// Git and GitHub
// you need to use these services to store your code.
// What is Git?
// it is a piece of software on your computer to manage changes you made to the codebase.
// git reporsitory is an empty bucket initially. It is like a project folder that contains all files and dictionaries related to your project. It stores the entire history of changes you made to your project.
// you need to tell Git to save a file you want to save. untracked files are files that you have not told Git about it. (git add info.txt)
// commit means you are going to save it in Git. (git commit -m "add new info.txt file for fun")
// What is GitHub?
// GitHub is a cloud service where git repositories are stored.
// If you save your code in Git, nobody else can see and modify it.
// If you want to share your code with other people and want to collaborate with them and want to be able to commit to it in the sourcecode,
// you can share it in GitHub.
// git log
// git status is to display the status of your working direcotry and staging area with respect to the git repository.
// staging area (a.k.a. index) is a middle ground between your working directory and the git repository. You can choose which changes  you want to include in your next commit.
// Use the git add command to stage specific modifications.
// working directory is where you make modifications to your files. You edit, create, or delete files.
// git init . is to make your local repository a git repository
// git add --all is to add all changes to the statging area.
// git commit -m "XYZ" is to create a new commit with a specified commit message.
// git push is used to upload local changes to a remote repository. Hence, Before using git push, you typically set up a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) where you want to send your changes.
// git tag is used to create a tag in a Git repository.
// git push --tags is used to push tags from your local Git repository to the remote repository.
// git diff is used to see differences you made. You can scroll down by presssing enter. To quit, press q.
