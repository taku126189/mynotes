// named routes vs anonymous routes
// routes are a journey. it has a start view and end view.
// named routes tell Flutter where to go beforehand.
// anonymous routes does not tell Flutter the final destination.

// Git and GitHub
// you need to use these services to store your code.
// What is Git?
// it is a piece of software on your computer to manage changes you made to the codebase.
// git reporsitory is an empty bucket initially. It is like a project folder that contains all files and dictionaries related to your project. It stores the entire history of changes you made to your project.
// you need to tell Git to save a file you want to save. untracked files are files that you have not told Git about it. (git add info.txt)
// commit means you are going to save it in Git. (git commit -m "add new info.txt file for fun")
// What is GitHub?
// GitHub is a cloud service where git repositories are stored.
// If you save your code in Git, nobody else can see and modify it.
// If you want to share your code with other people and want to collaborate with them and want to be able to commit to it in the sourcecode,
// you can share it in GitHub.
